# Honking Clown Paddleball

This project was created as a birthday gift for my friend, the paddleball honks whenever the ball hits the paddle. 

Inspired by [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAY56o2uVuM/), special thanks to [Kendall Makes Stuff](https://www.instagram.com/kendall.makes.stuff).
